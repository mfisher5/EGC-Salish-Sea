## Raw Sequencing Data

DNA Sequencing was completed on a MiSeq V2 300 Cycle Flow Cell at the [Northwest Genomics Center](https://nwgc.gs.washington.edu/) (University of Washington). Raw sequencing data files were uploaded as a tar archive to Globus by the Northwest Genomics Center, then downloaded to a local repository using Globus Connect. The tar archive was extracted with the following code on the *git bash* command line: `tar -xvf EGC_Diet.tar` (tar / GNU tar v1.34).

These files are too large to be saved on Github, but have been made publicly available at --. Quality control information associated with raw data files can be found in the **QC** subfolder.
