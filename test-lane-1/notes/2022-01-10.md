## Check read drop-out in Lane 1 FastQ files

After cutadapt, I get a huge drop-out of reads, particularly from the BF3 and Leray primer sets. For a lot of my samples, this leaves me with <10 read depth. I've shown this at the end of the [2.lane1.html file](https://github.com/mfisher5/EGC-Salish-Sea/blob/master/test-lane-1/scripts/2.split.primers.lane1.html), section "Check cutadapt output".

Looking back into the cutadapt log file, some of these are due to filtering for minimum length (esp. LerayXT). However, in the majority, the "Read 1 with adapter" is super low, and so cutadapt does not have many paired sequences to write out.

Weirdly, that looks pretty similar to the Leray forward primer sequence...
