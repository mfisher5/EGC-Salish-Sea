## Check read drop-out in Lane 1 FastQ files

After cutadapt, I get a huge drop-out of reads, particularly from the BF3 and Leray primer sets. For a lot of my samples, this leaves me with <10 read depth.

Looking back into the cutadapt log file, some of these are due to filtering for length. However, in the majority, the number of Read 1 with adapter is super low, and so cutadapt does not have many paired sequences to write out.
