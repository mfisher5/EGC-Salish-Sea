## Cutadapt
I ran the program *cutadapt v3.4* on windows. Following the [installation instructions](https://cutadapt.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation.html) I downloaded the executable file from the github releases page, and saved it into the "R" folder. 


## Virtual Machine

I used the VMWare Workstation 16 Player (Ubuntu 64-bit OS). Instructions for installing the VMWare Workstation can be found on [this third-party website](http://theholmesoffice.com/installing-ubuntu-in-vmware-player-on-windows/). 

- Select the option to "store virtual disc as a single file"
- Enable access to shared folders by doing the following before opening the VM: Player >> Manage >> VM Settings >> Options >> Shared Folders. Check off "Always enabled", then browse to select the folder(s) you want to add. 
- Ensure VM tools are updated by logging into the VM, then doing the following: Player >> Manage >> Reinstall VMWare Tools.
