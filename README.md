# European Green Crab Metabarcoding & Energetics

*Collaborators: Sean McDonald and Emily Grason of the WSG Crab Team, Ryan Kelly, Phil Levin*

1. What are invasive green crabs eating in the Puget Sound?
2. What recently invaded sites in the Puget Sound support the highest growth rates of green crab? How does this compare to growth in Willapa Bay, where there are established green crab populations?


## Objectives

**Sample** green crab from three sites in the Puget Sound and Bay Center, Willapa Bay where there is an established green crab population
- Bay Center samples will be a mix of samples frozen in dry ice, or kept cold in a cooler and transferred to a freezer within 3-4 hours.
- Existing Puget Sound samples are a mix of whole frozen green crab, and dissected gut contents stored in chilled ethanol


**Observe diet composition** with DNA Metabarcoding
- COI region, using Leray / LerayXT / BF3-BR2 primers (identify *one* to move forward with using first sequencing lane)
- Lab space: SEFS Shared Genetics Lab >> Kelly Lab
- Sequencing: PNW Genomics Center



**Visually evaluate** stomach fullness. 
- Use a semi-qualitative scale (0-3) to describe stomach fullness. Back up observations by weighing wet / dry weight of stomach contents for a subset of crab.



**Estimate site-specific growth rate** using bioenergetic models. By first parameterizing the bioenergetic model with mock communities / stepped PCR replicates, we can use the relative abundance index, plus temperature data from each site, and stomach fullness information, to calculate growth.
- A temperature logger is placed in green grab habitat at each sampling site



## Data Management
- Molecular data will be made available on a public database or as part of supplementary material 
- Bioenergetic models will be based on Kirstin Holsmanâ€™s NRG package
- Bioinformatics and additional bioenergetics scripts / output will be in a public, archived project repository on Github

## Results & Dissemination
- Newsletter write-up for WSG Crab Team
- Publication

What role can the researchers play in supporting community or organization actions?
