# European Green Crab Metabarcoding & Energetics

*Collaborators: Sean McDonald and Emily Grason of the WSG Crab Team, Ryan Kelly, Phil Levin*

1. What are invasive green crabs eating in the Puget Sound?
2. What recently invaded sites in the Puget Sound support the highest growth rates of green crab? How does this compare to growth in Willapa Bay, where there are established green crab populations?


## Objectives

**Sample** green crab from three sites in the Puget Sound and Bay Center, Willapa Bay where there is an established green crab population -- *WSG Crab Team*
- Bay Center samples will be a mix of samples frozen in dry ice, or kept cold in a cooler and transferred to a freezer within 3-4 hours.
- Existing Puget Sound samples are a mix of whole frozen green crab, and dissected gut contents stored in chilled ethanol


**Observe diet composition** with DNA Metabarcoding
- CO1 BF3/BR2 protocol available from Cordone et al. (2020 - preprint)
- Lab space: SEFS Shared Genetics Lab
- Sequencing:
- Bioinformatic assistance: Mary can work off of published pipelines, and learn from Ramon, Eily, and Erin in the Kelly Lab



**Visually evaluate** stomach fullness and diet composition. 
- How to deal with the likelihood of a high proportion of empty stomachs? Mary can follow up with Georgina Cordone, SERC group doing blue crab work, John Geller (CA) doing red rock crab work
- Ryan, Ole, Zach Gold are looking at limitations associated with relative abundance (e.g., use of mock communities). Could revisit necessity of gravimetric analysis.



**Estimate site-specific growth rate** using bioenergetic models. By first parameterizing the bioenergetic model with a gravimetric analysis, we can use the relative abundance index, plus temperature data from each site, and stomach fullness information, to calculate growth. -- Mary, working with Kirstin Holsman
- A temperature logger is placed in green grab habitat at each sampling site



## Data Management
- Molecular data will be made available on a public database or as part of supplementary material 
- Bioenergetic models will be based on Kirstin Holsmanâ€™s NRG package, published separately -- Mary will work out the details of this with Kirstin
- Bioinformatics and additional bioenergetics scripts / output will be in a public, archived project repository on Github

## Results & Dissemination
- Report or newsletter write-up for WSG Crab Team?
- Publication

To consider: How can the research be made useful to the people who participated?
Will there be separate outputs specifically for the collaborators?
What role can the researchers play in supporting community or organization actions?
