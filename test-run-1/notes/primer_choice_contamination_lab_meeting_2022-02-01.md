## Lab Meeting Feb 1.

### Primer Choice

- why is LerayXT not picking up Manila clam? Include in the mock community "Rosetta stone" lane. Also, really need to get DNA sequences into Geneious to determine if the degeneracy in the LXT primer is causing low amplification of clam DNA


### EGC Contamination of Dungies

- find out when contamination is occurring -- run the green crab qPCR assay on the Dungy DNA extracts. IF there is green crab DNA in the extracts, need to re-evaluate where dissections are occurring. IF there is not green crab DNA in the extracts, run a PCR with BF3/BR2 and quantify--> super low values indicate little to no DNA from the Dungy stomach is going into sequencing. 

- IF there is little to no DNA from the Dungy stomach going into sequencing:

1. etOH is interfering with the DNA extraction. switch to PBS, or RNA laster
2. look to aDNA protocols to figure out what to wash the stomachs out with, how to maximize high quality DNA.
